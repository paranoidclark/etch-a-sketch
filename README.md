# Etch-A-Sketch!

**February 9, 2024** 
Added a Grid System using Double For Loops. 

The first for loop adds the number of rows and placed them inside the Main Div Container (_600px_)

The second for loop adds the number of squares/grids and placed them inside each row. (_rowWidth / numGrid_)

Added the hover effect where every time a user hovers a grid square, it changes color. 

Added a live checking, and limitations. 

**CSS Styling** 

Font Color : `#F8EFBA`

Border : 0.2px solid `#FFFFFFF`
